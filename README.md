```
Question 1: "{ Morning | Afternoon | Howdy | Other random greetings } {name}, { how are you feeling? | are you ok? }"

Question 3:"Are you interruptable this afternoon?"
Options: { Yes | No }

This will output: { This morning | In the afternoon | All day (if both yes)| Not today (if both no) }

Option 4: "What are you thinking about today?"

**Scenario: @snookbot checks in with you**

+ Given it's a working day
+ When you log into Slack
+ And this is the first time you've stayed active for more than 15 minutes today
+ Then @snookbot will check in with you in a DM

**Scenario: You check in with @snookbot**

+ Given you want to update your status with @snookbot and the team
+ When you DM or @mention snookbot and say "Just checking in", use the phrases "checking in", "checkin" or "check in"
+ Then @snookbot will run the checkin script


**Scenario: The end of the day**

+ Given its the end of the day
+ Then @snookbot will clear all statuses and set up for the next day


**Scenario: You havn't checked in today (you're on holiday or not logged in)**

+ Then @snookbot won't store any data for you


#### Interruptable

**Scenario: Finding out who is interruptable today**

+ Given you want to find out who is interruptable
+ When you @mention snookbot and ask "Who is interruptable today?"
+ Then @snookbot will send you a list of who is interruptable and when.

Example response:
```"Looks like:"

**Lili** is **This Morning**
**Mat** is **This Afternoon**
**Izzy** is **All Day**
```

**Scenario: Finding out who is interruptable right now**

+ Given you want to find out who is interruptable right now for a call
+ When you @mention snookbot and ask "Who is interruptable now?"
+ Then @snookbot will send you a list of people who are active

#### Weather report

**Scenario: Getting a Snook weather report**

+ Given you want to get a weather report for the mood in Snook
+ When you ask @snookbot "What's the weather like today?"
+ Then @snookbot will see how people are feeling and prepare a weather report.

Example weather reports:
```
"It's going to be a sunny, sunny day",
"Looks like a warm day"
"Cloudy with a chance of rain",
"Generally sunny but there might be a few stormy clouds"
```
+ I have questions here, maybe this isn't appropriate...we don't want to stigmatise people who.
+ What do we need to think about legally and from a HR perspective of people making their mental health visible like this?
+ People can chose not to...?

Alternatively:
```
*Lili* is having a ðŸŒž day
*Mat* is have a ðŸŒ§ day
*Emma* is having a ðŸŒž

OR

*Lili* and *Emma* are having a ðŸŒž day
*Mat* is having a ðŸŒ§ day
```


**Scenario: Getting a weather report by studio**

+ Given you want to get a weather report for the mood in a Snook studio
+ When you ask @snookbot "What's the weather like in {location}?"
+ Then @snookbot will see how people are feeling and prepare a weather report.

Example weather reports:

```
"It's going to be a sunny, sunny day in {location}",
"Cloudy with a chance of rain in {location}",
"It might be a little stormy later in {location}"
```
